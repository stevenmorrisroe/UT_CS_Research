# LLM Planning Simulation Research

This repository contains code for ongoing research exploring LLM-based planning simulations using LangGraph. The simulation attempts to generate a sequence of steps to achieve a goal, considering initial knowledge (ground truths), potential problems (vulnerabilities), and resource constraints (budget, time). It uses Qdrant for semantic de-duplication of proposed steps and OpenAI models for reasoning.

## Setup

1.  **Navigate to the Phase_1 directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Phase_1
    ```
    *(All subsequent commands assume you are in the `Phase_1` directory)*

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv  # Use python3 or python depending on your system
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\\Scripts\\activate`
    ```
    *You should see `(venv)` appear at the start of your terminal prompt.*

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Ensure your virtual environment is active before running pip)*

4.  **Set up environment variables:**
    *   Create a file named `.env` **directly inside the `Phase_1` directory**.
    *   Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file like this:
        ```dotenv
        OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key_here'
        ```
    *   Replace `'your_openai_api_key_here'` with your actual key.

## Running the Simulation / Tests

The primary way to run the simulation is through the provided pytest tests, which execute predefined scenarios.

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment (`venv`) is active.** (See Setup Step 2)
2.  **Run pytest from the `Phase_1` directory:**
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    *Alternatively, if the venv is not active, you can run: `venv/bin/pytest`*

    This command will discover and execute the tests located in the `tests/` directory (specifically `test_graph_interaction.py`). The simulation progress for each scenario will be printed to your console.

    *Note: The tests make live calls to the OpenAI API and will incur costs.*

    **Troubleshooting:**
    *   **`OpenAIError: api_key... not set`**: Double-check that your `.env` file is correctly named, located in the `Phase_1` directory, and contains the `OPENAI_API_KEY` variable with your key. Ensure the virtual environment was active when installing requirements and running `pytest`.
    *   **`Recursion limit of X reached`**: Complex scenarios (like framing a house) might exceed the default step limit. If a test fails with this error, you can increase the limit by modifying the `recursion_limit` parameter within the `RunnableConfig` object in `tests/test_graph_interaction.py` for the specific scenario.

## Key Components

*   **LangGraph:** Used to define and execute the stateful planning simulation as a graph.
*   **OpenAI:** Language models (e.g., GPT-4o Mini) are used for generating ideas, predicting outcomes, making decisions, and summarizing state.
*   **Qdrant:** A vector database used locally to store generated ideas and check for semantic similarity to encourage novelty within simulation steps.
*   **Pydantic:** Used for defining the structure of the simulation state and ensuring type safety.

## Research Findings

See `results_comparison.md` for an analysis of example simulation runs comparing outcomes for different scenarios and highlighting the non-deterministic nature of the simulation for complex tasks.

## Using LangGraph Studio (Development Server)

For interactive development, debugging, and visualization, you can run the LangGraph development server and connect to the LangGraph Studio web UI:

1.  **Ensure setup is complete:** Make sure you have followed all steps in the [Setup](#setup) section, including activating your virtual environment (`venv`) and installing dependencies in editable mode (`pip install -e .` from the `Phase_1` directory).
2.  **Start the LangGraph Dev Server:** Run the following command from the `Phase_1` directory:
    ```bash
    langgraph dev --config plan_sim/langgraph.json
    ```
3.  **Access the Studio UI:** The server output will provide URLs, including one for the LangGraph Studio UI, similar to this:
    ```
    - ðŸŽ¨ Studio UI: https://smith.langchain.com/studio/?baseUrl=http://127.0.0.1:2024
    ```
    Open this URL in your web browser (Note: Safari might have compatibility issues with local servers).
4.  **Interact with the Graph:** The Studio UI allows you to:
    *   Visualize the graph structure (`plan_sim`).
    *   Invoke the graph with custom inputs.
    *   Inspect the state transitions at each step.
    *   Debug the execution flow.

**Important:** Running the `pytest` command executes the graph *directly* within the test process. It **does not** interact with the `langgraph dev` server or the Studio UI. Use the Studio UI for interactive sessions and `pytest` for running predefined test scenarios.
