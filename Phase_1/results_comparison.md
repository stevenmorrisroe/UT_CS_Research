# Simulation Run Comparison

This document compares the outputs of two consecutive runs of the `test_graph_interaction.py` script, focusing on the abilities (new truths) and vulnerabilities identified in each scenario.

## Run 1 Output Summary

### Leaky Faucet Scenario (Run 1)

*   **Goal:** Successfully fix a leaky kitchen faucet.
*   **Initial Ground Truth:** Standard faucet parts available, basic plumbing tools on hand, water shut-off valve functional.
*   **Initial Vulnerabilities:** Pipes might be older/brittle, unexpected corrosion possible.
*   **Outcome:** Success (Goal achieved in 4 steps).
*   **Key Step:** Purchase a faucet repair kit.
*   **Final Identified Abilities (New Truths):**
    *   Repair kit resolved the leak.
    *   Existing tools were adequate.
    *   Repair was quicker than anticipated.
    *   Pipe age/condition didn't hinder disassembly.
    *   Faucet lifespan extended.
*   **Final Identified Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Potential for future leaks if underlying pipe condition worsens.
    *   Risk of damaging faucet during reassembly.
    *   Repair kit might not cover *future* issues.
    *   Corrosion might affect other plumbing components.
    *   Repair might mask a larger issue.

### Frame House Scenario (Run 1)

*   **Goal:** Construct frame for a 2000 sq ft house.
*   **Initial Ground Truth:** Foundation poured, plans approved, lumber delivered, tools available.
*   **Initial Vulnerabilities:** Weather delays, lumber quality issues, measurement errors, crew availability.
*   **Outcome:** Abandoned (Hit failure condition after 19 steps).
*   **Key Steps/Ideas:**
    1.  Hire QC Inspector (Success)
    2.  Implement crew training program (Success)
    3.  Implement weather mitigation plan (Success)
    4.  Establish logistics/inventory system (Failure - led to abandonment)
*   **Final Identified Abilities (New Truths from successful steps):**
    *   QC inspector improves quality, detects issues early, improves morale/performance, ensures code adherence, helps timeline management.
    *   Training improves accuracy, reduces rework, boosts confidence/morale, fosters continuous improvement, benefits future projects.
    *   Weather protection reduces impact, allows better planning, improves efficiency, manages contingency budget, becomes standard practice.
*   **Final Identified Vulnerabilities (Accumulated):**
    *   Original vulnerabilities persist (Weather, Lumber, Measurement, Crew).
    *   QC Inspector: Dependence/bottleneck, crew resistance, cost increase if major issues found, overlooking issues, weather impact still possible.
    *   Training: Crew resistance, initial cost/budget strain, time delays, trainer dependency, skill retention variance.
    *   Weather Plan: Material cost/maintenance, crew fatigue/morale, forecast reliance risk, storage logistics, scheduling complexity.
    *   Logistics Failure: Increased shortage risk, waste/cost from quality issues, higher error likelihood, crew morale decline, delays.

    *   QC inspector improves quality, detects issues early, improves morale/performance, ensures code adherence, helps timeline management. *(Consistent)*
    *   Weather protection reduces impact, allows better planning, improves efficiency, manages contingency budget, becomes standard practice. *(Consistent)*
    *   Coordination team reduces miscommunication, improves schedule adherence, boosts accountability/morale, quickens issue resolution, improves organization.
    *   Pre-framing assessment reduces errors, minimizes material delays, improves staging efficiency, fosters teamwork, helps timeline management.
*   **Final Identified Vulnerabilities (Accumulated):**
    *   Original vulnerabilities persist (Weather, Lumber, Measurement, Crew).

    *   Digital Tool Failure: Lack of access/adoption, training needs, integration issues, budget underestimated, resistance, miscommunication risk, delays, frustration, unforeseen costs.
    *   Pre-framing Assessment: Unexpected site conditions still possible, dependency delays, crew morale risk if perceived negatively, staging miscommunication, weather impact still possible.

## Comparison and Observations

*   **Leaky Faucet Scenario:** The results were highly consistent across both runs. The AI identified the same core solution (repair kit) and generated the same set of resulting abilities and vulnerabilities. This suggests good stability for simpler, well-defined problems where the initial step likely leads directly to success.
*   **Frame House Scenario:** The results showed significant divergence between the two runs.
    *   **Path:** The sequence of proposed ideas and their success/failure outcomes differed. Run 1 failed on logistics, while Run 2 failed on training and a digital tool, but succeeded with coordination and pre-assessment steps.
    *   **Outcome:** Run 1 was abandoned due to a failed step, while Run 2 hit the recursion limit, indicating it continued exploring solutions but couldn't reach the goal within the step limit.
    *   **Abilities/Vulnerabilities:** While some core items related to the initial vulnerabilities and the QC inspector/weather plan were consistent, the subsequent steps introduced different sets of abilities and vulnerabilities based on the diverging paths. The failed steps (training in Run 2, logistics in Run 1) generated specific negative outcomes and vulnerabilities not seen in the other run.
*   **Overall:** The complexity and open-ended nature of the "Frame House" scenario led to non-deterministic behavior in the planning AI. Different ideas were generated, and the simulated outcomes (success/failure) for similar ideas (like training) varied. This highlights the sensitivity of the planning process to the LLM's generation and evaluation at each step, especially for complex goals with many potential actions and interacting factors.
