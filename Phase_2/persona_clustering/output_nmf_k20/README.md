# Persona Data

This directory should contain persona prompt files in the format `persona_topic_X_final_prompt.txt`.

The actual persona data files are excluded from version control due to their size.
You can obtain them by either:

1. Running the persona generation scripts (see documentation)
2. Downloading them from the shared data repository
3. Requesting them from the project administrator

## File Format

Each persona file should contain a structured prompt that defines a customer persona derived from NMF analysis of purchase data.
